However, most Malamutes today are kept as family pets or as show or performance dogs in weight pulling, dog agility, or packing. Malamutes are generally slower in long-distance dog sled racing against smaller and faster breeds, so their working usefulness is limited to freighting or traveling over long distances at a far slower rate than required for racing. They can also help move heavy objects over shorter distances. An adult male Alaskan Malamute can pull around 500\u20131,500 kilograms (1,100\u20133,300 lb) of weight, depending on build and training."},{id:"Fjgjmb2kcke4",name:"Nemo",age:2,breed:"Kurilian Bobtail",gender:"female",color:"light brown",image:"https://www.royal-canin.ru/upload/iblock/901/glavnaya.jpg",description:"In the wild, this cat is an excellent fisher and hunter, which may explain why the Kurilian loves to play in water.

They are highly loyal and make ideal working dogs. It is for this reason that this breed is known as 'the gentle giant'. International kennel clubs generally describe the breed as having a sweet temper. It typically has a deep bark and is easy to train if started young. They are wonderfully good with children, but small children can get accidentally leaned on and knocked down. Newfoundlands are ideal companions in the world of therapy and are often referred to as the nanny dog. The breed was memorialized in 'Nana', the beloved guardian dog in J.M. Barrie's Peter Pan. The Newfoundland, in general, is good with other animals, but its size can cause problems if it is not trained."}]},63:function(e,a,t){e.exports={wrapp:"PetItem_wrapp__31OQS",image:"PetItem_image__16Iwg",text:"PetItem_text__IXGQZ",data:"PetItem_data__FwEoR",itemHead:"PetItem_itemHead__2kCcQ",itemDescript:"PetItem_itemDescript__PnDJw"}},67:function(e,a,t){"use strict";t.r(a);var n=t(1),i=t.n(n),o=(t(61),t(62)),l=t(63),s=t.n(l),r=function(e){var a=e.image,t=e.name,n=e.age,o=e.gender,l=e.color,r=e.breed,d=e.description,h=e.alt;return i.a.createElement(i.a.Fragment,null,i.a.createElement("h2",{className:s.a.itemHead},"All about ",t),i.a.createElement("div",{className:s.a.wrapp},i.a.createElement("img",{src:a,alt:h,className:s.a.image}),i.a.createElement("div",null,i.a.createElement("p",{className:s.a.text},"Age: ",i.a.createElement("span",{className:s.a.data},n)),i.a.createElement("p",{className:s.a.text},"Gender: ",i.a.createElement("span",{className:s.a.data},o)),i.a.createElement("p",{className:s.a.text},"Color: ",i.a.createElement("span",{className:s.a.data},l)),i.a.createElement("p",{className:s.a.text},"Breed: ",i.a.createElement("span",{className:s.a.data},r)))),i.a.createElement("p",{className:s.a.itemDescript},d))};r.defaultProps={alt:"Photo pet"};var d=r,h=t(9),c=t.n(h);a.default=function(e){var a=e.match,t=e.history,n=a.params.id;return i.a.createElement("div",{className:c.a.container},i.a.createElement("button",{className:c.a.button,type:"button",onClick:function(){return t.push("/pets")}},"Return"),i.a.createElement(d,function(e,a){return e.find(function(e){return e.id===a})}(o,n)))}}}]);
